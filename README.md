## Overview
Given the data from the 2019 StockX Data Contest, I unfortunately did not hear about this until 2021, but I still decided to do my own analysis. With the resale market becoming more popular everyday, the main purpose of this analysis was see which brand and which shoe had the best return on investment. While exploring the data, I was able to gather other insights about total sales for each brand, each region, and so on. 

The Python libraries I used in this project are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and math. 


## About the data
StockX is basically the stock market for sneakers. People can buy and sell their personal sneakers and get them authenticated through StockX. StockX provides the middle man service and a bunch of other great insights about sneakers. This dataset specifically focuses on Yeezy and Off-White x Nike sales on StockX from September 2017 to February 2019. The data provided was already cleaned and ready to be analyzed. 

**The primary goals of this project are as follows:**

1. Which brand generated more sales over the provided duration of order dates? (Sept. 2017 - Feb. 2019)
2. Which regions had the most sales/transactions? Based on Yeezys/Off-White?
3. Which shoe was the "best" investment? In other words, which shoe has the highest ROI?
4. Given the shoes with the highest ROI, when was the best time to sell those shoes?
